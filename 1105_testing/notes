1. task1-4 code complete
2. need testing on IR sensors after changing the middle one.
3. start from task1 (9-2-1) and see whether it goes straight forward in node2
4. fine tune PID values (in ChassisSkeletonCoded.cpp line595-606) by using the bridge: 
    - start from tuning kp first (with correct kp, the car can go onto the bridge already)
